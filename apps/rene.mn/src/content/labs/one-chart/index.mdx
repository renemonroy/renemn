For developers who want to build a group of powerful D3 charts faster, 1Chart is a Proof of Concept project that explores the possibility to simplify the creation of charts while following a consitent and simple pattern.

Unlike D3 alone, where you need to spend time dealing with its sometimes complex syntax and organization, this PoC focuses on building powerful charts through the use of JS/JSON schemas.

### Motivation

There are plenty of use cases for charts and D3 has been the go-to for many years. But somehow I feel it still misses the development experience that makes us select it as immediate first choice to create a great set of charts. Moreover, D3 is a so convenient tool that it lets you do a lot of other things as well and that advantage sometimes left no easy control over UIs dedicated to pure graphs.

The idea behind this PoC is to ease the creation of charts following a single pattern while giving the consistency required to have multiple yet different graphs. 1Chart is basically a mix between a D3 wrapper and an UI Library that is focused only on charts.

### Examples

<ChartsProvider theme={{ def: { borderRadius: "0.5rem" } }}>
  <div style={{ height: "400px", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
    <OneChart data={bubblesData} isLoading={false} schema={bubblesSchema} />
  </div>
</ChartsProvider>
